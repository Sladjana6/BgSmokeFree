**Gallery - Photo Gallery** is a cool responsive image gallery plugin with awesome views. Which allows you to add unlimited galleries and unlimited images in your prefered format.
WordPress Photo Gallery plugin is a free gallery plugin with many functionalities and parameters. Our Photo Gallery has two different ways of uploading: Single image upload and multiple images upload. You can add unlimited photo galleries and images to your site and not forgetting about the fact that our Photo Gallery plugin is very simple and easy to use. 

Photo Gallery plugin has two important and useful advantages:
thumbnail size and images lazy loading features.
The image gallery plugin also has an responsive lightbox which gives a beautiful effect to the gallery and provides slideshow of your photos.

== The features that Photo Gallery plugin provides: == 

* **Multi images upload**: There is a multiple images upload button in the admin dashboard which allows you to add as many images as you want at once. 
* **Simple image upload**: You can add pictures to your Gallery one by one.
* **Lightbox Gallery**: Photo Gallery provides a beautiful slideshow to your photo album.
* **Image attributes**: Every image has attributes: title, alt, description and URL. The simple photo gallery fills the title and alt attributes automatically (by the name that you have given to the pictures in your PC) which makes your work easier. And as for the URL you can add the URL address of whatever you want.
* **Image ordering**: The arrangement of the pictures is being done by Title, Date and Random.
If random arrangement is selected, every time when you reload the page photo gallery plugin shows you random images from your single gallery.It helps you to create random gallery with random photos, which can grab your users attention. The arrangement of pictures in gallery can be done also by drag and drop.
* **Thumbnail size**: You are given a possibility to choose your preferable thumbnail size.The thumb will load faster when you choose small thumbnail size (from wordpress default image sizes). In our Gallery plugin, you will not meet any inconvenience with the speed. And thank this the time of the load is shorten.
* **Images loading**: Global Loading and Lazy Loading.
* **Gallery width**:  This parameter is useful because most of the people use gadgets and different devices for the Internet (for 100%, leave blank).This is the fully responsive Picture Gallery.
* **Column count**: You can choose the number of columns (only in grid view).
* **Gallery type**: **Grid view**, **Mosaic view** and **Masonry view**. Mosaic and Masonry view will provide a beautiful effect to your Gallery. And the Grid view, of course, which is a default view. (there are 30+ awesome views in [Pro](https://ays-pro.com/index.php/wordpress/photo-gallery) version)


Now, let's turn to the Photo Gallery style options. Here the plugin has more than 10 cool hover effects for photos. You can also change the transparency level of the hover overlay of the image. It has hover icons and hover zoom effect. The images in the photo gallery are zoomable.
There is gallery lightbox main color option, which allows you to choose your preferred color for lightbox and image overlay. 

The page will load faster due to the Thumbnails Size and Lazy Loading parameters. 
This is wordpress image gallery plugin with thumbnails. For the fast performance of the images here comes lightweight thumbs.
What is Image Loading Parameter? It is a functionality which helps to your site to load faster. 
 **Global Loading** and **Lazy Loading**: Global loading is the load of the Gallery with images (when the loading finishes the Gallery and images open together) and the other one is when the Gallery opens but the images are loaded one by one. And this will not slow down your site.
 
From the point of view of marketing, we can say, that all the images in the Gallery have alt attribute through which the page **SEO** rank raises. The load time is faster than anywhere. It is the best photo gallery
plugin in the wp directory. For example, if you are a photographer, architecture, make-up artist, programmer, designer, etc. you can show your works by making your own free galleries from your photo library. The Photo gallery plugin allows to create awesome photographers gallery,architectures gallery, make-up artists gallery, programmers gallery, designers gallery and etc.  As your users first of all want to see your jobs and if you have a site the first issue is the gallery of your works. It is an open secret, that 70% of nowadays people use their cellphones as a means of interaction on the Internet. So, here we offer responsive Gallery and responsive Lightbox. You just arrange your portfolio with the help of our Image Gallery plugin. Your portfolio images will be in a high quality with this easy image gallery plugin. And in this way you can provide your works to your users with elegant and modern views such as Mosaic and Masonry view.
